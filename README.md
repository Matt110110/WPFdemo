# WPFdemo
This is a repository to store some of my demo WPF apps. It will contain some useless and meme apps that I make along the way to increase my understanding of the topic. 

## Albanian Virus
* This is the first app of this repo.
* Its just a WPF app that give you two buttons. One button opens the `C:\Program Files` folder while the other closes the app.
* To make it more exciting I named it as a virus and asked the users to delete some of their own files.
* No offesnse to anyone from Albania. Its just a joke.
